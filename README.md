# SuperheroApp

This is a web application which manages my kids favorite superheroes and which was built for training purposes only.

The framework uses Angular, Bootstrap and Web API ASP.NET Core. The database layer uses SQLite.

Although it has some personal inputs, the app is mostly based on Neil Cummings' tutorial from Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/
