# SuperheroApp

This is a web application which manages my kids favorite superheroes. It is intended for training purposes only and will stand as my C#/ASP.NET school project.

SuperheroApp is a single-page application built with:
- ASP.NET Core and C# for cross-platform server-side code
- Angular and TypeScript for client-side code
- Bootstrap for layout and styling
- SQLite as the database layer

The app contains my personal inputs but is also based on Neil Cummings' tutorial from Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/
