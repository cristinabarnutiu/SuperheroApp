# SuperheroApp

A web app which manages my kids favorite superheroes and uses Angular, Bootstrap and ASP.NET Core Framework

This app was built for training purposes only and is based on Neil Cummings' tutorial from Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/
