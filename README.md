# SuperheroApp

This is a web application which manages my kids favorite superheroes. It was built for training purposes only (as my C#/ASP.NET project).

The framework uses Angular, Bootstrap and Web API ASP.NET Core. The database layer uses SQLite.

The app contains several personal inputs but is mostly based on Neil Cummings' tutorial from Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/
