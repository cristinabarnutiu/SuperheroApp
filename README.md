# SuperheroApp

This is a web application which manages my kids favorite superheroes. It is intended for training purposes only and will stand as my C#/ASP.NET school project.

SuperheroApp is a single-page application built with:
- ASP.NET Core WebAPI (v3.1) and C# for cross-platform server-side code
- Angular (v8) and TypeScript (v3.9) for client-side code
- 3rd party client-side code libraries: JSON Web Tokens, Alertify JS (v1.13) and Ngx (ngx-bootstrap, ngx-gallery)
- Bootstrap (v4.5) and Font Awesome (v6) for UI layout and styling
- Bootswatch (4.5) theme 'SpaceLab'
- SQLite as the database layer

Among the tools used: Visual Studio, DB Browser for SQLite, Postman, JSON Generator, Chrome dev tools

The app contains my personal inputs but is also based on Neil Cummings' tutorial from Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/
