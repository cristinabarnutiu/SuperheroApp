# SuperheroApp

A web application which manages my kids favorite superheroes.

The application framework uses Angular, Bootstrap and ASP.NET Core and a SQLite database.

This app was built for training purposes only and is based on Neil Cummings' tutorial from Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/
